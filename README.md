This data set comprises 10 <i>trans</i> compound and their corresponding <i>cis</i> isomers.
4a-4g refer to the compounds that have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 in each terminal alkyl chain respectively, while NA refers to the compound that has 11 carbon atoms, which is not synthesized experimentally.
1,3-diazo and 1,3-diester are the central structures to compare the impact by changing linkages in central bent-core (2 azos vs 2 esters)
